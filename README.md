These are my configs for my workspace.

The i3 configs I use with swaywm (https://github.com/swaywm/sway). It is a little buggy but I still love it.

For my school projects I use VIM with Vundle including:

	c.vim and NERTDTree



P.S. I am still learning so there will be changes (I hope perpetual)
